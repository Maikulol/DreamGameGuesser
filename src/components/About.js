                        This project has been a goal of mine for over 2 years now, ever since its first 
                        iteration that I designed in grade 10. Since then, my coding knowledge has advanced 
                        exponentially, and my ideas have grown with it. I hope this creation offers
                        some entertainment for you.</h4>
