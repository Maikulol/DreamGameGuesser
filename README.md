## What is DGG?

### DGG is an interactive website that provides the user with a large selection of the top rated games from the last decade and a half. Users are able to search through this list of games by name or use the website's engine feature to provide them with a list of games tailored to their preferences. 

## How to use DGG?

### DGG's backend and frontend are publicly accessible, however the full functionality of the website relies on the API token that is not public. Because of this, you will not be able to locally run the full version of the web app. 

### In order to run the frontend and the backend without the API, run the following commands.

## Front End
    npm install
    npm start

## Back end
    npm install
    npm run dev
